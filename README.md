# Kinetic DApp Demo

The Kinetic DApp Demo is a lightweight starter app based on the [Solana DApp Scaffold](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold) that will get you up and running with Kin as quickly as possible using our new Kinetic API.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The responsive version for wallets and wallet adapter may not function or work as expected for mobile based on plugin and wallet compatibility. For more code examples and implementations please visit the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/).

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

## Features
